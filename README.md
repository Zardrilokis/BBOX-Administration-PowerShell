# BBOX-Administration-Powershell

This is my first shared programm on Github :)
So I would ask you to be indulgent with the way it has been developed.
I remain however interested in your constructive comments to help me improve it.

This Tool is based and developed in PowerShell to get BBOX information.
It is only avalaible in english.
It can be used only with a Bouygues Telecom (BYTEL) router.
I can't test this program with all BYTEL routers.
So please find below all router and API version and firmware i can tested :
