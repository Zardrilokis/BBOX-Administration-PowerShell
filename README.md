# BBOX-Administration-Powershell

This is my first shared programm on Github :)
So I would ask you to be indulgent with the way it has been developed.
I remain however interested in your constructive comments to help me improve it.

This Tool is based and developed in PowerShell to get BBOX information.

It use : 
- API rest developed by Bouygues Télécom (https://api.bbox.fr/doc/apirouter/index.html)
- Microsoft Powershell in version 5.1.18362.1171
- Powershell web request with Chrome Driver Service (https://chromedriver.chromium.org)

For the moment, this version can only Get / Read / Download BBOX informations.
In the future, you will do these actions :
- GET
- PUT
- POST
- DELETE

All action will be do by Web request from ChromeDriver.

In bref, Collect, Modify, Remove, BBOX information using Bytel API Web request, with PowerShell script.
